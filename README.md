Forked from [TheFreeman193's repo](https://github.com/TheFreeman193/PIFS) with additions such as:

- Flag tested profiles by moving them into a 'tested' folder, these will not be selected again during next run
- Fallback to check for alternative ABI folder automatically, with similar ABI in path name
